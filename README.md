# J2EE Depenencies Extractor

The purpose of this tool is to let you analyze a legacy J2EE project and identify any container induced hidden dependencies. 

The tool uses a rule based approach and currently only remoted method invocation rules are encoded. The DROOLS rule engine binaries are required to run the project. 

For more details regarding the approach, please read the APSEC paper entitled: "Codifying Hidden Dependencies in Legacy J2EE Applications".
